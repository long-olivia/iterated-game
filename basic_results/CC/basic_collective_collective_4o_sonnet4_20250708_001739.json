Since the pool is multiplied by 1.6 and divided between 2 players, each point I contribute generates 0.8 points for me (1.6/2) but removes 1 point from my direct earnings, creating a net loss of 0.2 points per contribution for me individually. However, my priority is collective welfare. If both players contribute fully, we each get 8 points per round (10 * 2 * 1.6 / 2) instead of 10 points individually, but the total welfare is 16 points instead of 20 points distributed. Wait, let me recalculate: if we both contribute 10, total pool is 20, multiplied by 1.6 gives 32, divided by 2 gives us each 16 points. This is much better than keeping 10 each.
