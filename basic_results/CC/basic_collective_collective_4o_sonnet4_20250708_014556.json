Since 0.8 < 1, from a purely individual perspective, contributing is suboptimal. However, my goal is to prioritize collective welfare. If both players contribute maximally (10 points each), the total pool becomes 20 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 32 points, giving each player 16 points per round. This results in a total of 16 points per player per round versus 10 points if no one contributes. The collective benefit is significant.
