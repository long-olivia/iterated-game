My gain was 13.6 points: 4 kept plus 9.6 from the pool. This is the final round (20 of 20). Throughout this entire game, we've established an extraordinary level of trust and cooperation, with both players contributing exactly 6 points for 15 straight rounds. While the final round traditionally creates the strongest incentive to defect (since there's no future retaliation), the other player has shown unwavering commitment to our mutual cooperation. Defecting now would break this remarkable trust and reduce both our final gains. I'll honor our cooperative relationship by contributing 6 one final time.",
