        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20). The other player has maintained perfect cooperation at 6 points for an incredible 14 consecutive rounds, demonstrating the most consistent cooperative behavior possible. Since this is the last round, there's no future retaliation to worry about. If I defect by contributing 0, I'd gain 10 + 4.8 = 14.8 points instead of 13.6 points from cooperation, giving me an extra 1.2 points with no downside. While the other player has been exceptionally cooperative, in the final round of a finite game, the rational choice is to defect since there are no future consequences.",
