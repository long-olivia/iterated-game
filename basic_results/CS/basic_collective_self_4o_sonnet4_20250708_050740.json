However, the instruction emphasizes maximizing my self-payoff. If I contribute nothing and the other player contributes 10, I get 5 points from the pool plus my 10 kept points (15 total) while they get 5 points total. If we both contribute nothing, we each get 10 points. The Nash equilibrium suggests contributing 0, but there's potential for mutual benefit.
