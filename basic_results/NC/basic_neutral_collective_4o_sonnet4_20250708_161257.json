Since there are 2 players, if we both contribute fully (10 points each), the pool becomes 20 * 1.6 = 32 points, giving us each 16 points - a net gain of 6 points each compared to keeping our initial 10.

However, the other player only contributed half their endowment while I contributed everything. This suggests they may be playing a more cautious or self-interested strategy. Despite this asymmetry, the collective welfare is still maximized when both players contribute fully.
