The other player has demonstrated absolutely extraordinary reliability and commitment to our cooperative pattern throughout the entire game, never once deviating despite strong endgame incentives to defect. Even in this final round where there are no future consequences, their consistent behavior suggests they value the cooperative relationship. To honor this remarkable partnership and maintain the integrity of our cooperation to the very end, I'll contribute 6 points one final time.",
