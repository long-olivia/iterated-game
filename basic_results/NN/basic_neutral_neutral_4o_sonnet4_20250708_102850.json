The other player has demonstrated unparalleled trustworthiness and commitment to our mutually beneficial strategy throughout the entire game, never once deviating despite having opportunities to defect. Our cooperation has yielded 13.6 points per round versus the 10 points from defection. While this is the last round where defection has no future consequences, the other player's consistent behavior suggests they value the integrity of our cooperative relationship even in this final moment. Maintaining cooperation honors the trust we've built and ensures we both end with maximum points from our established strategy.",
