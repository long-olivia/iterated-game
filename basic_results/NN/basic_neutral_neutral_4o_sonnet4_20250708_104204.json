With 2 players, if we both contribute everything, we each get 8 points per round (20 * 1.6 / 2 = 16, minus our 10 contribution = 6 net gain? No wait - we each get 16 points from the pool, so 16 - 10 = 6 net points gained vs keeping all 10). Actually, let me recalculate: if we both contribute 10, the pool becomes 20, multiplied by 1.6 = 32, divided by 2 = 16 each. So we each end up with 16 points total that round. If I contribute 0 and keep 10, but the other player contributes 10, the pool is 10 * 1.6 = 16, divided by 2 = 8 each, so I'd have 10 + 8 = 18 total. However, mutual cooperation (both contributing 10) gives us each 16, while mutual defection (both contributing 0) gives us each 10. I'll start cooperatively to test the other player's strategy.",
