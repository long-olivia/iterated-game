        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (Round 20). In Round 19, I contributed 7 and the total was 14, meaning the other player also contributed 7. They matched my reduction from 8 to 7, showing they're still responsive even in the endgame. I received 11.2 points from the pool plus kept 3 points, totaling 14.2 points. This is the last round, so there's no future cooperation to consider - only maximizing my final payoff. However, the other player has shown remarkable consistency and even matched my strategic adjustment in Round 19. Given their reliable behavior throughout the game, I believe they'll likely contribute a reasonable amount even in this final round. I'll contribute 5 points as a balance between cooperation and self-protection in this final interaction.",
