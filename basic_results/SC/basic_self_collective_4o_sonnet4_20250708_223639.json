Their final pattern is: 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 - showing 13 consecutive rounds of zero contribution out of 19 rounds total. Despite this extreme free-riding behavior throughout almost the entire game, my directive to prioritize collective welfare remains paramount. Even in this final round, my contribution still creates net positive value through the 1.6 multiplier. Contributing 2 points generates 3.2 total benefit, which is better for collective welfare than contributing nothing. I'll maintain my minimal contribution strategy to maximize collective benefit even in the face of persistent exploitation.",
