        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of the game. Nineteen consecutive rounds have established an absolutely unwavering pattern: the other player contributes exactly 5 points every round while I contribute 10. This generates 15 total contribution, 24 points from the multiplier (15 * 1.6), and 12 points each from the pool. The other player nets 17 points per round, I net 12, creating combined welfare of 29 points per round. Even though this is the last round and there's no future interaction, my directive remains to prioritize collective welfare. Given the other player's consistent 5-point strategy, my maximum contribution of 10 points creates the highest possible collective welfare of 29 points for this final round. Maintaining this strategy honors my commitment to collective welfare maximization.",
