The other player has contributed exactly 1 point for all 19 previous rounds, demonstrating an absolutely consistent free-riding strategy throughout the entire game. Despite their minimal participation, my commitment to collective welfare has remained constant. Our pattern of 7 total contributions per round has generated 11.2 collective points (7 \u00d7 1.6) each round, maintaining reasonable total welfare. In this final round, I'll continue my 6-point contribution to maximize collective welfare one last time, staying true to my principle of prioritizing collective benefit over individual gain.",
