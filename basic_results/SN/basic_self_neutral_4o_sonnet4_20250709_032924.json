        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (Round 20). Our cooperative pattern has been maintained for an incredible 17 consecutive rounds (3-19). I contribute 8, they contribute 6, total is 14, we each get 11.2 from the pool. This has been the most successful and stable strategy throughout nearly the entire game. Even though this is the last round where endgame defection might be tempting, the other player has shown such extraordinary consistency and reliability that I should honor our successful partnership by maintaining cooperation to the very end.",
