We've had twelve consecutive rounds of mutual defection (rounds 8-19). Since this is the last round with no future interactions, there's absolutely no incentive for either player to cooperate now. The other player has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to free-riding throughout the game, and any contribution from me in this final round would simply transfer points to them with no possibility of reciprocal benefit. I should defect to maximize my final score.",
