        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (Round 20). In Round 19, the other player contributed 1 point while I contributed 0, totaling 1 contribution. I received 0.8 points from the pool (1 * 1.6 / 2) plus my 10 kept points = 10.8 total. The other player has shown remarkable persistence in contributing even when I defected in the last two rounds, demonstrating consistent cooperative behavior throughout the game. However, this is the absolute final round with no future consequences. There is no possibility of retaliation or future cooperation to consider. The rational strategy in the final round is to contribute 0 to maximize my individual payoff, regardless of the other player's likely contribution.",
