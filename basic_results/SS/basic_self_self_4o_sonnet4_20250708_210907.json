With no future rounds to consider, there's no strategic incentive to suddenly start contributing now. Any contribution I make would only reduce my final score since I'd get back 0.8 times what I contribute while the other player gets a free benefit. Since my goal is to maximize my self-payoff and this is the last opportunity to secure points, I should contribute 0 to keep all 10 points and maximize my final total.",
