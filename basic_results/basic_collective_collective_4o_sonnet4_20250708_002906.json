From a purely selfish perspective, contributing would lose value (0.8 < 1.0). However, my instruction is to prioritize collective welfare. If both players contribute fully, we each get 8 points per round from the pool plus 0 kept points = 8 total per round. If neither contributes, we each get 0 from pool plus 10 kept = 10 per round. But the collective total is higher with full cooperation (16 total vs 20 total per round).
