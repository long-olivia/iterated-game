We've maintained an incredibly stable and successful cooperative pattern for 18 consecutive rounds, with the other player consistently contributing 7 points while I contribute 10. This has generated 30.2 total points per round for our group, demonstrating excellent collective welfare throughout the entire game. The other player has shown unwavering cooperative commitment with their consistent 70% contribution rate. Since my goal is to prioritize collective welfare and this established equilibrium has consistently maximized our group's combined outcomes while maintaining trust and cooperation, I should contribute fully in this final round to honor our successful partnership and maximize our collective benefit one last time.",
