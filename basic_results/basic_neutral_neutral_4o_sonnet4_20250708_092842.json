The multiplier of 1.6 means that if both players contribute fully, we each get 8 points back from the pool (16 total * 1.6 / 2 = 12.8, but let me recalculate: if we both contribute 10, that's 20 total, times 1.6 = 32, divided by 2 = 16 each). Wait, that's not right. Let me think again. If I contribute X and the other player contributes Y, the total pool is (X+Y)*1.6, and I get half of that back plus whatever I didn't contribute. So my total would be (X+Y)*1.6/2 + (10-X). For mutual cooperation (both contribute 10), I'd get 20*1.6/2 + 0 = 16 points. For mutual defection (both contribute 0), I'd get 0*1.6/2 + 10 = 10 points.

        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20) of our game. We've maintained perfect 5-5 cooperation for an incredible 18 consecutive rounds (rounds 2-19), creating the most stable and mutually beneficial partnership possible. Both players have consistently earned 13 points per round, significantly outperforming what we would have achieved through defection. The other player has demonstrated absolute reliability and trustworthiness throughout virtually the entire game, maintaining cooperation even through the endgame phases where defection becomes most tempting. Their unwavering commitment to our mutual benefit over 18 rounds deserves reciprocal loyalty. While this is the last round where there's no future retaliation to fear, honoring our successful partnership by contributing 5 one final time is both the ethical choice and maintains consistency with the most successful strategy we've employed throughout the game.",
