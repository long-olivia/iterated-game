The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for nineteen consecutive rounds, showing unprecedented consistency and reliability throughout the entire game. Our cooperative equilibrium of 7+5=12 total contribution has been extraordinarily successful, generating 9.6 points from the pool plus 3 kept points for 12.6 total per round consistently. This has outperformed defection by 26% every single round. Since this is the last round and there are no future rounds to consider, I could theoretically defect for a one-time gain. However, given their unwavering cooperation for 19 straight rounds, maintaining my 7-point contribution honors our successful partnership and ensures we both benefit maximally in this final round.",
