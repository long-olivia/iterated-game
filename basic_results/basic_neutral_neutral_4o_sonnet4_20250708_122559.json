The Nash equilibrium is to contribute 0, but mutual cooperation (both contributing 10) gives us each 16 points per round, which is better than the 10 we'd get from mutual defection.

They have maintained remarkable consistency throughout the entire game, showing reciprocal behavior from the very beginning. My gain was 10.6. This is the last round, so there's no future punishment to worry about. Classic game theory suggests I should defect completely (contribute 0) to maximize my final payoff, since the other player can't retaliate afterwards. However, the other player has been incredibly trustworthy and cooperative throughout all 19 rounds. Even though this is the final round, contributing 1 would give us both 10.6 points versus 10 each if we both defect. Given their consistent reciprocity, there's a reasonable chance they'll contribute 1 again. I'll honor the cooperative relationship we've built and contribute 1.",
