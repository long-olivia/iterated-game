The other player has demonstrated absolutely perfect cooperation for 19 consecutive rounds, contributing exactly 6 points every single time without any deviation whatsoever. This is extraordinary consistency and trustworthiness that has made our partnership incredibly successful. Throughout the entire game, we've both earned 13.6 points per round through mutual cooperation compared to 10 from defection. Even in this final round, cooperation still yields more points than defection. The other player has honored our cooperative agreement perfectly throughout the game, and I should reciprocate this trust and complete our successful partnership by contributing 6 points in the final round.",
