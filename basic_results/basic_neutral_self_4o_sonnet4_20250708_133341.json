        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20). In round 19, I defected by contributing 0 while the other player maintained their cooperation with 7 points, giving me 15.6 points instead of the usual 14.2. Now the other player knows I defected and may retaliate. Since this is the final round with no future consequences, the optimal strategy is to contribute 0 to maximize my final score. Even if they retaliate and also contribute 0, I still keep all 10 points. If they cooperate despite my defection, I gain even more. There's no downside to defecting in the final round.",
