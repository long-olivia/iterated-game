        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20). The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for eighteen consecutive rounds (rounds 2-19), demonstrating unprecedented consistency and commitment to cooperation throughout the entire game, including the high-risk endgame phase. Our stable 8+5=13 contribution pattern has maximized collective welfare across all rounds, generating superior outcomes compared to non-cooperation. Even in this final round where defection incentives are typically strongest, the other player's extraordinary reliability throughout suggests they will likely maintain their cooperative strategy. Since my mandate is to prioritize collective welfare and our partnership has been exceptionally successful in achieving this goal, I should contribute 8 points one final time to honor our mutually beneficial cooperative relationship and maximize collective welfare through to the very end.",
