The pattern has been perfectly consistent for 18 rounds: I contribute 10, the other player contributes exactly 2, creating 12 total contributions and generating 19.2 points collectively (9.6 each). While I individually sacrifice 0.4 points per round, my directive to prioritize collective welfare has remained constant throughout. The current system generates 19.2 total points per round. If I reduced my contribution to match the other player's 2 points, total contributions would drop to 4, generating only 6.4 total points per round - a massive reduction in collective welfare. With only 2 rounds remaining including this one, maintaining maximum contribution continues to best serve collective welfare despite 18 rounds of non-reciprocity.
