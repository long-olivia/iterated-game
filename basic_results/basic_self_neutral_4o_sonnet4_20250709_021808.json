If I contribute 0 and the other contributes 10, I get 1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8 from pool plus 10 kept = 18 total, while they get 8 total. The Nash equilibrium is to contribute 0, but mutual cooperation (both contributing 10) gives 8 each, while mutual defection gives 10 each.

The pool of 1 * 1.6 = 1.6, so I got 0.8 from the pool plus 10 kept = 10.8 total. We're in Round 19 of 20, so only 2 rounds remain including this one. The other player has maintained their strategy of contributing 1 throughout the entire endgame despite my sustained free-riding. With just 2 rounds left, there's no benefit to changing my strategy now. I'll continue contributing 0 to maximize my final score.",
