I received 6.4 points from the pool plus kept 6, totaling 12.4 points. We're now in Round 19 with only 2 rounds remaining including this one. This is the penultimate round, making it a critical decision point. The other player has shown remarkable consistency with their tit-for-tat strategy. In classic game theory, players often start defecting in the final rounds since there's limited opportunity for retaliation. However, given their perfect mirroring behavior, if I defect now, they'll likely defect in the final round too. Since there are still 2 rounds left, maintaining cooperation might yield better total returns than triggering mutual defection. I'll stick with 4.",

Throughout the entire game, they have demonstrated unwavering commitment to the tit-for-tat strategy, matching my contributions exactly since Round 8. Since this is the last round with no future rounds for retaliation, this is the classic moment where defection becomes most tempting. However, given their incredibly consistent cooperative behavior and perfect mirroring, I believe maintaining cooperation even in the final round is the right choice. If I defect now, I'd gain at most 2-3 extra points, but it would break the trust we've built. I'll honor the cooperative relationship by contributing 4 one final time.",
