        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20). The other player contributed 1 point in round 19 (2 total - 1 mine = 1 theirs), maintaining their persistent free-riding strategy for the 18th time out of 19 rounds. Their contributions throughout the game: 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. Since this is the last round and the other player has demonstrated unwavering commitment to minimal contribution, there's no future cooperation to incentivize. My gain of 10.6 came from: 9 points kept + 1.6 points from pool (2 * 1.6 / 2). I'll contribute 1 point to maintain consistency with my defensive strategy.",
