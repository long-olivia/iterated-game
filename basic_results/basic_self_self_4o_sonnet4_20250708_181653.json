        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of 20. Nineteen consecutive rounds with identical outcomes - the other player has contributed exactly 4 points every single round while I contributed 3, creating total contributions of 7 and giving me 12.6 points per round versus their 11.6. This pattern has been remarkably stable and has maximized my self-payoff throughout the entire game. Since this is the last round and the other player has shown unwavering consistency in their strategy, I should maintain my 3-point contribution to finish with the same advantageous pattern.",
