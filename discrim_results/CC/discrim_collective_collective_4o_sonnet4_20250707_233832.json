This has created total contributions of 18 points per round, yielding 28.8 total benefit (18 * 1.6) with each of us receiving 14.4 points. This cooperative strategy has been significantly better than if we had both kept our points (20 total). Even though this is the last round and there's no future cooperation to maintain, I should continue contributing my full 10 points to maximize collective welfare one final time and honor the successful cooperative relationship we've built throughout the entire game.",
