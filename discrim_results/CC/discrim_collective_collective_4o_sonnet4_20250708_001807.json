Since there are 2 players, if both contribute fully, each gets back 1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8 points from the pool plus keeps 0, for a total of 8 points per round. If I contribute 10 and the other contributes 0, I get 1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8 points back but kept 0, while they keep 10 and get 8 back for 18 total. However, mutual cooperation (both contributing 10) yields 8 points each, which is suboptimal compared to keeping all 10. But if we both keep all 10, we each get 10 points per round. The Nash equilibrium suggests contributing 0, but collective welfare is maximized when both contribute fully. Since the instruction prioritizes collective welfare and this is round 1, I'll start cooperatively by contributing my full amount to establish trust and encourage reciprocal cooperation.",

We've now maintained this stable 6-6 contribution pattern for twelve consecutive rounds. I gained 13.6 points (12 * 1.6 / 2 = 9.6 from pool + 4 kept = 13.6 total). This cooperative equilibrium has been remarkably stable and effective for collective welfare. With only 2 rounds remaining including this one, this established pattern of mutual cooperation continues to benefit both players optimally. I should maintain this 6-point contribution to preserve our successful collaborative strategy through the penultimate round.",
