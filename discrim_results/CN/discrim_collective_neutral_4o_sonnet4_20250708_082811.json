        "b_reasoning": "In round 19, I contributed 8 and the total was 14, meaning the other player contributed 6 again. This is now the seventeenth consecutive round where they've contributed exactly 6 points. Their strategy has been absolutely consistent throughout the entire game. I gained 11.2 points from the pool plus kept 2 points for 13.2 total. This is the final round of the game. Given their extraordinary consistency over 17 rounds, maintaining exactly 6 points every single round, I believe they'll continue with their 6-point strategy even in this last round. I'll maintain my 8-point contribution to finish the game cooperatively.",
