This creates a strong incentive for cooperation. However, there's also an incentive to free-ride - if the other player contributes 10 and I contribute 0, I'd get 10 (kept) + 8 (from pool) = 18 points. But if we both think this way, we both get only 10 points each.

Since mutual cooperation would give us both 16 points per round (if we both contribute 10), but they seem stuck at contributing 5, I need to consider my strategy.
