Wait, let me be more careful: if I contribute X and the other player contributes Y, the total pool is (X+Y)*1.6, and I get (X+Y)*1.6/2 back from the pool, plus I keep (10-X) points. So my total is (10-X) + (X+Y)*1.6/2 = 10 - X + 0.8*(X+Y) = 10 + 0.8*Y - 0.2*X. To maximize this, I want to minimize X (contribute 0) regardless of what the other player does.
