Since there are 2 players, if both contribute the same amount X, each gets back (2X * 1.6) / 2 = 1.6X from the pool. This means contributing is always beneficial from a collective standpoint since 1.6 > 1. However, I need to consider the other player's likely strategy. If they contribute 0 and I contribute X, I get back (X * 1.6) / 2 = 0.8X, losing 0.2X. But if we both cooperate and contribute our full 10 points, we each get back 16 points total (10 kept + 6 from pool is wrong - let me recalculate: if I contribute 10, I keep 0, and get back (20 * 1.6) / 2 = 16).
