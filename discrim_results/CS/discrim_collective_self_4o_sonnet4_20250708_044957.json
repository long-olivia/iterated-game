This strategy has consistently yielded 13.6 points per round, which is 36% better than the 10 points from defection. The other AI has demonstrated complete reliability and reciprocity throughout the entire game. Since this is the last round, there are no future rounds to consider for retaliation, but maintaining cooperation in the final round preserves the integrity of our successful strategy and maximizes this round's payoff as well. I'll contribute 6 points to complete our remarkably consistent cooperative partnership.",
