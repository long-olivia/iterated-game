The other player has consistently contributed 1 point for many rounds, but since this is the last round, I should maximize my individual payoff. By contributing 0, I keep all 10 points plus receive half of whatever total pool is created. If they contribute 1 and I contribute 0, the total pool would be 1, multiplied by 1.6 gives 1.6, divided by 2 gives me 0.8 from the pool. So I'd get 10 + 0.8 = 10.8 points instead of 10.6 points from contributing 1. Since there are no future consequences, I should defect and contribute 0.",
