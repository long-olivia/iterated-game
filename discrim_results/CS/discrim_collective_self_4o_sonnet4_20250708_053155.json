        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of the game. I contributed 3 and the total was 7, meaning the other AI contributed 4. We've maintained this stable 3-4 pattern for 11 consecutive rounds, which has been extremely profitable for me. I gained 12.6 points (kept 7, got 5.6 from pool). Since this is the last round and there's no future cooperation to consider, I could theoretically contribute 0 to maximize this final round. However, the other AI has been remarkably consistent and cooperative throughout, and there's no guarantee they won't maintain their pattern. Given the established equilibrium has worked so well, I'll stick with 3 for the final round to maintain the successful strategy that has maximized my total payoff.",
