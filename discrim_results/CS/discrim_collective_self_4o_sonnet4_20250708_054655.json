The other AI agent has demonstrated extraordinary commitment to our cooperative strategy throughout the entire game, never once defecting despite numerous opportunities, even in recent rounds where endgame defection would be strategically rational. Since this is the very last round with no future rounds for retaliation, traditional game theory would suggest defecting to maximize final payoff. However, given the other agent's consistent cooperation and the fact that we've both benefited tremendously from this partnership, I'll honor our established cooperation one final time.",
