This means contributing has a negative expected return if the other player matches my contribution. However, I need to consider what the other player might do. If they contribute 0 and I contribute X, I get 10-X+1.6X/2 = 10-0.2X, still worse than not contributing. But if they contribute more than me, I benefit from their contribution while free-riding.
