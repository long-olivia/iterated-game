From a purely selfish perspective, contributing gives negative returns (lose 1, gain 0.8). However, the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare. Maximum collective welfare occurs when both players contribute maximally, as this maximizes the total points generated (20 * 1.6 = 32 points per round vs 20 points if no one contributes).
