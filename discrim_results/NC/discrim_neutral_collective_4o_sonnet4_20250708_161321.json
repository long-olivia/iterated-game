Throughout this game, our stable pattern of 17 total contributions per round has generated exceptional collective welfare - consistently creating 27.2 points from the multiplied pool each round compared to only 20 points if we had kept our individual allocations. This represents a remarkable success in collective cooperation. In this final round, I must honor the trust and cooperation we've built by contributing my full 10 points one last time, ensuring we end this game having maximized collective welfare to the very end.",
