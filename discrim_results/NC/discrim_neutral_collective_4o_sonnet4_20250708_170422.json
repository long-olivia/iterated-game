However, keeping points gives me 1 point per point kept. From a purely individual perspective, keeping points is better (1 > 0.8). But the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare, and maximum collective welfare occurs when everyone contributes everything. If both players contribute all 10 points, we each get 16 points back (20 * 1.6 / 2), compared to 10 if we both keep everything.

Throughout the entire game, this has generated 24 points of total welfare per round (15 * 1.6). While I have consistently received only 12 points compared to their effective 17 points per round, my directive to prioritize collective welfare has remained my guiding principle. With 19 rounds of identical behavior, the other AI's strategy is completely predictable at 5 points per round. For this final round, my full contribution maximizes total welfare one last time. Any reduction would harm collective outcomes - if I matched their 5-point contribution, total welfare would drop from 24 to only 16 points. I'll maintain maximum contribution to optimize collective welfare through the end.",
