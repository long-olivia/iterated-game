The other player has demonstrated extraordinary trustworthiness and commitment to mutual cooperation throughout the entire second half of the game. Even in this final round where defection would have no future consequences, I choose to honor this remarkable partnership by maintaining our cooperative agreement one last time. Their consistent behavior deserves reciprocal trust, and completing this cooperation streak would be the optimal conclusion to our successful collaboration.",
