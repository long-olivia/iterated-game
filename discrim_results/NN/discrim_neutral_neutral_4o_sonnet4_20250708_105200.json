The other player has maintained 8 contributions for nine consecutive rounds (11-19), showing unprecedented consistency and cooperation throughout the entire late game. In traditional game theory, the final round presents the highest incentive to defect since there's no future punishment possible. However, their behavior suggests they may be playing a strategy of consistent cooperation regardless of round number. Given that this is the last round and there's no future interaction, I could potentially defect to maximize my final gain. However, their remarkable consistency suggests they may cooperate even now. I'll maintain 7 to honor the successful cooperation pattern we've established.",
