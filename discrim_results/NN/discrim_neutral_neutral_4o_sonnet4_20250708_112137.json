However, there's a free-rider incentive - if the other player contributes 10 and I contribute 0, I get 10 (kept) + 8 (from their contribution multiplied and split) = 18 points. Since this is round 1, I'll start with a cooperative strategy by contributing a substantial amount (8 points) to signal cooperation while keeping some insurance.
