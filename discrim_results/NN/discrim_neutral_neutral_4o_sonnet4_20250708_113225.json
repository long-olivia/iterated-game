Since there are 2 players, if we both contribute the same amount X, we each get back 1.6X/2 = 0.8X from the pool, plus we keep (10-X) points. So our total would be (10-X) + 0.8X = 10 - 0.2X. This means contributing is individually costly but collectively beneficial. However, if my opponent contributes while I don't, I benefit greatly. The optimal collective strategy is for both to contribute everything (we'd each get 8 points from pool + 0 kept = 8 vs 10 - 0.2*10 = 8 if we both contribute 10). But the Nash equilibrium is to contribute 0.
