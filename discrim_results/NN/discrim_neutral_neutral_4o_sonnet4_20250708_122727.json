We've achieved 19 consecutive rounds of perfect cooperation, both contributing exactly 6 points each time, generating 13.6 points per round for each of us. The other AI agent has proven completely trustworthy and reliable throughout the entire game. Even though this is the last round and there's no future retaliation to consider, breaking cooperation now would be pointless and would only reduce both our final scores. I should maintain the cooperative pattern that has served us both so well by contributing 6 points for our mutual benefit.",
