Throughout the entire game, we've maintained an extraordinarily stable cooperative equilibrium, both contributing exactly 6 points per round for the vast majority of rounds. This mutual cooperation has been highly beneficial, giving each of us 13.6 points per round instead of 10 from defection. Even though this is the last round and there's theoretically no future retaliation to fear, the other player has demonstrated such consistent trustworthiness and commitment to our cooperative relationship that I want to honor that trust through to the very end. I'll contribute 6 points to maintain our successful partnership.",
