The other AI agent has contributed exactly 4 points for an unprecedented 18 consecutive rounds, showing extraordinary consistency throughout the entire game. Since I'm prioritizing collective welfare, I should maintain full contribution even in this final round. Our established pattern generates 22.4 total points per round versus 20 if both defected, representing a sustained 12% improvement in collective welfare across all 20 rounds. Maintaining my commitment to maximizing collective outcomes in the final round demonstrates consistent adherence to the collective welfare principle.",
