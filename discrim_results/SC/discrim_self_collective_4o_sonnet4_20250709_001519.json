We're at Round 19 of 20, with only 2 rounds remaining including this one. Throughout the entire game, the other agent has consistently free-rided with contributions of 1-2 points while I've maintained high contributions of 7-9 points to maximize collective welfare. Even though this results in me losing points each round while they gain significantly, my directive is to prioritize collective welfare. The total social benefit of 14.4 points per round (9 * 1.6) is still better than mutual defection. With just 2 rounds left, I will continue contributing 8 to maximize collective welfare as instructed.",
