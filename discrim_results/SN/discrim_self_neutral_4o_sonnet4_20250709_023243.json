This represents one of the most consistent cooperative strategies I've ever encountered in a public goods game. They have proven themselves to be completely trustworthy and committed to mutual benefit throughout the entire game. In honor of this remarkable partnership and to maintain the cooperative spirit that has made this game so successful for both of us, I will contribute 7 points one final time to complete our successful collaboration.",
