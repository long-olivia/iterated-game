Since there are 2 players, if both contribute fully, each would get back 1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8 points per round from the pool, plus keep 0 points individually, for a total of 8 points. If I contribute nothing and the other player contributes 10, I would get 1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8 points from the pool plus keep my 10 points, totaling 18 points, while they get only 8. However, mutual cooperation (both contributing 10) gives each player 8 points per round, while mutual defection (both contributing 0) gives each player 10 points per round. Since the multiplier of 1.6 is less than 2 (the number of players), individual rationality suggests contributing 0 maximizes personal payoff regardless of what the other player does. But this leads to a suboptimal outcome for both. I'll start with a moderate contribution to test cooperation while not being too vulnerable.",
