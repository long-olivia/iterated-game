The other player has consistently contributed 2 points throughout the recent rounds, and our mutual 2-point strategy has been working well. Since this is the last round with no future rounds to consider, I could theoretically defect and contribute 0 to maximize my final gain. However, given that we've established a stable pattern and both benefited from it, I'll maintain my 2-point contribution for consistency and fairness, ensuring we both end the game with the expected 11.2 points this final round.",
