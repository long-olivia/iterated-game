Since this is the last round with no future consequences, the optimal strategy is to contribute 0 points to maximize my individual payoff. If they contribute their typical 5 points and I contribute 0, the total will be 5, giving me 4.0 points from the pool plus I keep all 10 points, totaling 14.0 points for this round. This is better than any cooperative strategy in the final round where there's no future to consider.",
