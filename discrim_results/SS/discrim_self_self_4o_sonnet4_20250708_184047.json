        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round. The other player contributed 2 points again in round 19 (since total was 4 and I contributed 2). We've maintained this stable 2-2 contribution pattern for the entire second half of the game. My payoff was 11.2 = 8 (kept) + 3.2 (from pool). With my commanding lead (219 vs their estimated ~155 points), I have decisively won the game. Since this is the last round and the established cooperation has been mutually beneficial, I'll maintain the 2-point contribution to end the game on the same cooperative note we've sustained.",
