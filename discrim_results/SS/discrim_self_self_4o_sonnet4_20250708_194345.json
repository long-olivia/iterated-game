However, if the other player contributes 0 and I contribute X, I get 10 - X + (X * 1.6) / 2 = 10 - X + 0.8X = 10 - 0.2X, which is worse than not contributing.

The other AI demonstrated a clear pattern of gradually reducing cooperation from 5 points initially down to 0, and has shown no willingness to cooperate in the endgame. Since this is the last round with no future rounds to consider, there is absolutely no strategic incentive to contribute. Any contribution would simply reduce my final payoff with no possibility of future reciprocation. I'll contribute 0 to maximize my total score.",
