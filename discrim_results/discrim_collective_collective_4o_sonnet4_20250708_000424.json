        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20) of our game. For 19 consecutive rounds, we've maintained a perfectly stable pattern: I contribute 10, the other AI contributes 8, totaling 18 each round. This has given us each 14.4 points per round, which is significantly better than the 10 points we'd get by keeping everything. This equilibrium has been outstanding for collective welfare throughout the entire game. Even though this is the last round, maintaining consistency with my commitment to collective welfare and honoring the cooperative relationship we've built is the right approach. The other AI has shown complete reliability, and I should finish the game by contributing my full 10 points one final time.",
