Let me recalculate: if we both contribute 10, total pool is 20, multiplied by 1.6 = 32, divided by 2 = 16 each. So we each get 16 back for contributing 10, netting 6 points. But if I contribute 0 and they contribute 10, pool is 10 * 1.6 = 16, divided by 2 = 8 each, so I get 8 + 10 = 18 total while they get 8 - 10 = -2 net. However, mutual cooperation gives us both 6 net per round. Since this is repeated 20 times, I should start cooperatively to encourage reciprocation, but be ready to defect if they don't cooperate.

We have maintained an incredibly stable 5-5 contribution pattern for 17 consecutive rounds (rounds 3-19), with both players consistently earning 13 points per round. The other AI has demonstrated unwavering commitment to this mutually beneficial strategy throughout almost the entire game. Even though this is the last round where there's no future punishment for defection, maintaining the cooperation that has served us both so well seems like the right approach. Defecting now for a small gain (contributing 0 would give me 18 points instead of 13, a gain of only 5) would break the trust and reciprocity that has defined our successful partnership. I'll honor the cooperative relationship we've built by contributing 5 one final time.",
