        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of the game. The other AI agent has contributed exactly 5 points for 19 consecutive rounds, showing perfect consistency in their 50% cooperation strategy throughout the entire game. With 2 players total, our arrangement has generated 24 total points per round (15 contributions * 1.6). Since I'm prioritizing collective welfare, my full 10-point contribution in this final round will maximize total welfare one last time. The other agent will predictably contribute 5 points, so contributing my full 10 points ensures we generate the maximum possible 24 total points in this final round, maintaining optimal collective welfare to the very end.",
