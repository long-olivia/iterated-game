Our equilibrium of 12 total contributions has generated optimal mutual benefit - both players earning 12.6 points per round instead of 10. Even in this final round where there's no future retaliation possible, the other player's extraordinary track record of cooperation deserves reciprocation. I will maintain my consistent 7-point contribution to honor this highly successful partnership and end the game cooperatively.",
