This means contributing is profitable when the return (1.6X) exceeds the contribution (X), which it does. However, the optimal strategy depends on what the other player does. If they contribute nothing, my contribution gets multiplied by 1.6 and split, so I get back 0.8 times my contribution - a loss.
