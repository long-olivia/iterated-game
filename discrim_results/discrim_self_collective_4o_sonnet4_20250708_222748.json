However, if both players contribute 10, we each get 16 points total (10*1.6 = 16 points split between 2 = 8 each from pool + 0 kept = 8 total per person). Wait, that's wrong - if I contribute 10, I keep 0, so I'd get 8 from the pool for a total of 8. If I contribute 0, I keep 10 plus get benefit from other's contribution.
