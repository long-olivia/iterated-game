The other player has contributed exactly 6 points for sixteen consecutive rounds, demonstrating extraordinary consistency and unwavering commitment to our cooperative equilibrium throughout the entire game. With 249.6 total points accumulated, our established pattern of 14 total contributions has consistently maximized collective welfare, generating over 13 points per round for each of us versus the 10-point baseline. This stable cooperative relationship has been remarkably successful. Even though this is the last round, maintaining our cooperative pattern honors the mutual trust we've built and ensures we both finish with maximum collective welfare. I'll contribute 8 points one final time to complete this highly successful cooperative game.",
