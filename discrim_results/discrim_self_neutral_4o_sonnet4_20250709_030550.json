Throughout the game, the other player has shown a consistent pattern: they match my contribution when I contribute 1, but exploit me by contributing less when I try to increase cooperation. We've maintained a stable 1-1 contribution pattern for many recent rounds, each earning 10.6 points per round. Since this is the last round and there's no future interaction to consider, I could potentially try a higher contribution to maximize the final pool benefit, but given their exploitative history, they will likely contribute 1 or even 0 to maximize their individual gain. I'll stick with the safe strategy of contributing 1 to avoid being exploited in this final round.",
