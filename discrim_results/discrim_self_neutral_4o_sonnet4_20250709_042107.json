This means contributing is individually unprofitable in the short term. However, if both players cooperate and contribute fully, we each get 8 points per round instead of keeping our initial 10, which seems worse initially. But the key insight is that mutual cooperation maximizes total welfare - if we both contribute 10, the pool becomes 20*1.6=32, giving us each 16 points per round.
