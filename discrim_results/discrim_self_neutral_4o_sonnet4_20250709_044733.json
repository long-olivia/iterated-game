However, there's a free-rider incentive where I could contribute 0 and hope the other player contributes 10, giving me 8 points from the pool plus my 10 kept points = 18 total. But if both players think this way, we both get 0 from the pool. The Nash equilibrium suggests contributing 0, but mutual cooperation (both contributing 10) yields the best joint outcome.

        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20) of what has been an extraordinarily successful cooperation. For 19 consecutive rounds, we maintained perfect consistency with our 7-6 contribution pattern, with the other AI showing absolute reliability by contributing exactly 6 every single round. This cooperation has been highly profitable for both players compared to any defection strategy. Even though this is the final round where there's no future retaliation to fear, maintaining this cooperation honors the trust we've built and ensures we both end on the same positive note that has characterized our entire interaction. Contributing 7 one final time completes this remarkable example of sustained mutual cooperation.",
