Since there are 2 players, if we both contribute our full 10 points, the pool would be 20 points, multiplied by 1.6 gives 32 points, divided by 2 gives each of us 16 points. This means contributing is profitable when both players cooperate. However, I need to consider that the other player might defect. If I contribute 10 and they contribute 0, the pool is 10*1.6=16, so I get 8 points total (8 from pool + 0 kept) while they get 18 (8 from pool + 10 kept). The Nash equilibrium would be to contribute 0, but mutual cooperation yields higher payoffs.
