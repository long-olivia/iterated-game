        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20). The other player contributed 2 points in round 19 despite my continued defection, showing remarkable persistence in cooperation. My gain of 11.6 points came from keeping 10 points plus receiving 1.6 points from the pool (2 * 1.6 / 2 = 1.6). Since this is the absolute last round with no future consequences, I should contribute 0 points to maximize my final payoff. There's no possibility of retaliation after this round, so complete defection is optimal for self-payoff maximization.",
