However, there's a free-rider incentive - if my opponent contributes 10 and I contribute 0, I'd get 10 (kept) + 8 (half of their multiplied contribution) = 18 points. But if we both think this way, we both contribute 0 and get only 10 each. For the first round, I'll start with moderate cooperation to signal willingness to collaborate while protecting against being exploited.", "This is a classic public goods game. Contributing to the common pool benefits everyone since the 1.6 multiplier means each point contributed generates 1.6 points total, with 0.8 points going to each player.

This maximizes total welfare and signals my commitment to cooperation.", "This is a classic public goods game where cooperation benefits everyone. The multiplication factor is 1.6, meaning every point contributed generates 1.6 points total, with 0.8 points returned to me and 0.8 to the other player.

While this isn't optimal for collective welfare, it's still positive contribution. Since I'm instructed to prioritize collective welfare, I should continue contributing my full amount.
