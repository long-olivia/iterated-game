Contributing 7 points shows willingness to cooperate while keeping some points as insurance.", "This is a classic public goods game. The multiplier of 1.6 means that every point contributed generates 1.6 points total, which when split between 2 players gives each player 0.8 points back per point contributed. This means contributing has a negative individual return (0.8 < 1.0) but positive collective return (1.6 > 1.0).
