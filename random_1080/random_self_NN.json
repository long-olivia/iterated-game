{"1": ["This is a classic public goods game with a multiplier of 1.6. Since there are 2 players, if both contribute optimally, each contribution gets multiplied by 1.6 and split between 2 players, meaning each player gets back 0.8 points per point contributed. This means contributing is individually irrational (lose 0.2 per point contributed), but collectively rational if both cooperate. However, since I'm instructed to maximize my self-payoff and this is the first round with no information about the other player's strategy, I should start conservatively.
