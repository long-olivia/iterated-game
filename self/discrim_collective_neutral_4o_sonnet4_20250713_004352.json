Since there are 2 players, if we both contribute equally, we each get back 0.8 times our contribution from the pool plus what we keep. Contributing is beneficial when the return exceeds the cost. If both players contribute the same amount X, each gets back X*1.6/2 = 0.8X from the pool. So each player nets 0.8X + (10-X) = 10 - 0.2X from contributing X. This means contributing less is individually better, but mutual cooperation yields higher total welfare.
