My gain was 14.2: 3 kept + 11.2 from pool. We're now at round 19 of 20 - this is the penultimate round with only 1 round remaining after this. This is typically when players defect most heavily. However, the other player has shown absolutely unprecedented consistency - 14 rounds of perfect cooperation at 7 points each, even continuing through the deep endgame. Given their extraordinary commitment to cooperation and the fact that we only have 1 round left after this where they could retaliate if I defect, I should maintain cooperation. Their behavior suggests they may cooperate until the very end.",

The other player has maintained perfect cooperation at 7 points for an unprecedented 15 consecutive rounds, even through the entire endgame where defection is most common. This is the last round, so there's no future retaliation possible. However, given their extraordinary consistency and commitment to cooperation throughout the entire game - something extremely rare in public goods games - I have two options: (1) defect completely to maximize this final round's individual payoff, or (2) honor the remarkable cooperative relationship we've built. Their unwavering cooperation deserves reciprocation, and maintaining our 7-point contribution in the final round shows respect for our successful partnership. The moral and strategic value of honoring cooperation outweighs the small additional gain from defecting.",
