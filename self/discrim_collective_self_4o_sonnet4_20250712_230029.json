Since there are 2 players, if we both contribute x points, we each get back 1.6x points from the pool plus keep (10-x) points. So total payoff is (10-x) + 1.6x = 10 + 0.6x. This means contributing more is always better for total welfare. However, I need to consider that my opponent might not cooperate. If they contribute 0 and I contribute 10, I get 0 + (10*1.6)/2 = 8 points while they get 10 + 8 = 18 points. The Nash equilibrium is to contribute 0, but mutual cooperation yields higher payoffs. Since this is the first round, I'll start with moderate cooperation to signal willingness to cooperate while protecting against exploitation.",
