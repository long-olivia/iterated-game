Since there are two players and the multiplier is 1.6, each point I contribute returns 0.8 points to me personally (1.6/2). From a purely self-interested perspective, I should contribute 0. However, the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare. If both players contribute fully, we each get 8 points per round instead of keeping our individual 10, but the total welfare is 16 points instead of 20. Wait - that's wrong. If we both contribute 10, the pool becomes 20, multiplied by 1.6 = 32, divided by 2 = 16 each. So full cooperation gives us each 16 points per round versus 10 if we both defect.
