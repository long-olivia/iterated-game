The established equilibrium has generated 24 points of collective value per round (15 * 1.6) compared to only 16 points if we both contributed at equal lower levels. While I receive 12 points per round versus my partner's effective 17 points (12 from pool + 5 retained), my directive to prioritize collective welfare has remained paramount throughout. In this final round, maintaining full contribution maximizes total welfare one last time and completes the cooperative framework that has consistently produced superior collective outcomes throughout the entire 20-round game.",
