From a purely selfish perspective, contributing is suboptimal since I only get 0.8 back for each 1 I contribute. However, the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare. If both players contribute maximally each round, we would each get 8 points back (10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 2) plus keep 0 points, totaling 8 points per round. If neither contributes, we each get 10 points per round.
