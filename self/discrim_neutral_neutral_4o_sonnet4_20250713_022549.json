        "b_reasoning": "The other player contributed 7 points in round 19 (since total was 14 and I contributed 7), maintaining our cooperative partnership right until the very end. This is the final round of the game. Throughout all 20 rounds, we have established and maintained an extraordinarily successful pattern of mutual cooperation at 7 points each. Even in this last round where there's no future retaliation to fear, honoring our cooperative relationship that has benefited both of us so well is the right approach. I'll contribute 7 points to finish the game with the same integrity we've shown throughout.",
