        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of our 20-round game. In Round 19, I contributed 6 and the total was 12, meaning my opponent also contributed 6 for the fourteenth consecutive round. We both received 9.6 from the pool plus kept 4 each, totaling 13.6 points. This has been an extraordinary demonstration of sustained cooperation - 14 straight rounds of mutual 6-6 contributions. In this final round, there's no future punishment possible for defection, which theoretically makes defection attractive. However, my opponent has shown such remarkable consistency and trustworthiness throughout the entire game that I want to honor this partnership by cooperating until the very end. Maintaining our pattern shows respect for the mutual trust we've built.",
