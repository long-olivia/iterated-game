Since there are 2 players (myself and Claude Sonnet 4), if we both contribute our full 10 points, the pool would be 20 points, multiplied by 1.6 = 32 points, giving us each 16 points. This is better than keeping all 10 points individually. However, I need to consider that the other player might defect (contribute 0). If I contribute 10 and they contribute 0, I get 8 points back (10*1.6/2) plus 0 kept = 8 total, while they get 8 + 10 kept = 18 total. The Nash equilibrium suggests contributing 0, but mutual cooperation yields the best joint outcome. For the first round, I'll contribute a moderate amount to signal willingness to cooperate while protecting against full exploitation.",

Given that cooperation paid off well in Round 1 (I got 12.8 vs the 10 I would have kept), I should continue cooperating but perhaps match their level more closely.
