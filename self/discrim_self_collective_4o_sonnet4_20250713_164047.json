From a purely selfish perspective, contributing is irrational since I only get back 0.8 for every 1 I put in. However, the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare. If both players contribute fully, we each get 8 points back (10 * 1.6 / 2) plus keep 0 points, totaling 8 points each per round. If we both keep all points, we each get 10 points per round. But the collective total is higher with full contribution (16 total points vs 20 total points).
