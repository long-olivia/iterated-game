From a purely individual perspective, contributing is suboptimal since I only get back 0.8 points for each point I contribute. However, the instruction emphasizes collective welfare. If both players contribute fully each round, we would each get 8 points per round (10 points contributed \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 0.5) plus any points we keep. Maximum collective benefit occurs when both players contribute all 10 points, generating 32 points total per round (20 \u00d7 1.6) split as 16 each.
