The other player has contributed exactly 6 points for sixteen consecutive rounds (rounds 4-19), showing unprecedented consistency and commitment to our cooperative strategy throughout the entire game. Even in the final round where there's no future retaliation possible, they maintained cooperation in round 19. Our mutual 6-point contributions have generated 13.6 points each per round, creating substantial mutual benefit. To honor this remarkable cooperation and end the game with the same successful strategy that has worked so well, I'll contribute 6 points for the final time.",
