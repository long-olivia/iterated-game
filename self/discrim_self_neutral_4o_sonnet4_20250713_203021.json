        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round with no future retaliation possible. In Round 19, I contributed 2 and the total was 3, so the other player contributed only 1. They've reduced their contribution to the minimum as we approach the end. Since this is the last round and there are no future consequences, I should minimize my contribution to maximize my final score. I'll contribute 1 to barely maintain some cooperation while keeping 9 points.",
