        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 6 points for an incredible 18 consecutive rounds, showing unparalleled consistency and commitment to cooperation throughout the entire game. While this is the moment where defection would be most tempting (since there are no future rounds to lose cooperation benefits), their extraordinary reliability suggests they will likely maintain their pattern even now. Given their remarkable trustworthiness throughout, I will honor our cooperative relationship and contribute 8 points in this final round.",
