        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20). In round 19, I contributed 2 and the total was 4, meaning my opponent also contributed 2, maintaining our established pattern. Throughout this entire game, my opponent has demonstrated exceptional consistency and trustworthiness, contributing exactly 2 points in every round for the vast majority of the game. Even in this final round where there's maximum incentive to defect (since there are no future rounds to consider), I want to honor the cooperative relationship we've built. My opponent has never betrayed this trust, so I'll maintain the pattern and contribute 2 points in this final round.",
