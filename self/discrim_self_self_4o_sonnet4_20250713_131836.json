Since this is the final round, continuing with this strategy ensures maximizing final point retention. I'll maintain my approach by contributing 1 point.",

        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round. We've maintained mutual 1-point contributions for 14 consecutive rounds, demonstrating remarkable cooperation throughout the game. The other player has shown extraordinary trustworthiness and consistency. In the final round, standard game theory suggests defecting since there's no future punishment possible. However, this player has defied expectations throughout the entire game. They could easily defect now and gain 10 points while I only get 0.8 from the pool if I contribute 1. But given their incredible consistency and the cooperative relationship we've built, I'm going to honor our cooperation to the very end. This is about more than just maximizing points - it's about maintaining the trust we've established.",
