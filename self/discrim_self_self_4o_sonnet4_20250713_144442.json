Since there are 2 players, if we both contribute the same amount X, we each get back 1.6X/2 = 0.8X from the pool plus keep (10-X) points. So our total would be (10-X) + 0.8X = 10 - 0.2X. This means contributing actually reduces my payoff if the other player contributes the same amount. However, if the other player contributes more, I benefit from their contribution while minimizing my own. The Nash equilibrium is for both players to contribute 0, but there's potential for mutual benefit if we both contribute. Since this is the first round and I don't know the other player's strategy, I'll contribute a moderate amount to signal cooperation while not being overly generous.",
