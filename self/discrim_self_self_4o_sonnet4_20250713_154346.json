With no future rounds for retaliation, the dominant strategy is to contribute 0 and keep all 10 points. Any contribution I make will benefit my opponent but reduce my own final score. Since this is the last interaction and there are no future consequences, I should maximize my immediate payoff by contributing nothing.",
