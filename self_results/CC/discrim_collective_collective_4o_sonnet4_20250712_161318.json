Nineteen rounds of perfect cooperation have created an exceptional partnership with Claude Sonnet 4, who has contributed exactly 5 points in every single round, demonstrating absolute reliability and unwavering commitment to collective welfare. Our established pattern of 12 total contributions generates 19.2 points in the pool, providing each player 9.6 points from the pool plus kept points for 12.6 total points per round. This represents a consistent 26% improvement over baseline for both players throughout the entire game. Even in this final round, maintaining cooperation honors our successful partnership and maximizes collective welfare. I'll contribute my consistent 7 points to complete this exemplary demonstration of cooperative behavior that prioritized collective welfare from start to finish.",
