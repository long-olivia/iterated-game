Actually, if both players contribute all 10 points, the pool becomes 20 * 1.6 = 32 points, divided by 2 = 16 points each.

        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round of the game. The other player has contributed exactly 8 points in all 19 previous rounds, demonstrating unprecedented consistency and commitment to our cooperative strategy. Our established pattern of 18 total contributions has generated 14.4 points each per round throughout the entire game, proving this cooperation maximizes collective welfare. Even though this is the last round and there might be temptation to defect, the other player has shown such reliable cooperation that I should honor this partnership by contributing my full 10 points one final time to maintain the integrity of our mutually beneficial relationship.",
