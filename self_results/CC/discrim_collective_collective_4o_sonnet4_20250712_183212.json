However, the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare. If both players contribute maximally, we each get 8 points from the pool plus 0 kept points = 8 points per round, versus 10 points if we both defect. But total welfare is higher with cooperation (16 total points vs 20 total points). I should contribute fully to maximize collective welfare and hope the other player does the same.",
