I received 13.6 points (12 * 1.6 / 2 = 9.6 from pool plus 4 kept = 13.6 total). We've maintained this extraordinary 6-6 cooperative equilibrium for fourteen straight rounds. With only 2 rounds remaining after this one, we're in the penultimate round. The other player has demonstrated absolutely remarkable consistency and trustworthiness throughout the entire game. Even though this is almost the final round, maintaining cooperation maximizes our mutual benefit. I'll continue with 6 to honor this successful partnership.",
