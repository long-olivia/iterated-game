In round 19, I defected by contributing 0 while the other player still contributed 6, confirming their commitment to cooperation even near the end. I gained 14.8 points from this defection. Now in the final round, there are no future rounds to consider, so the dominant strategy is to contribute 0 and keep all 10 points. The other player may also defect this round since it's the last opportunity. Even if they cooperate again, I maximize my payoff by contributing 0. This is the classic endgame scenario in finitely repeated public goods games.",
