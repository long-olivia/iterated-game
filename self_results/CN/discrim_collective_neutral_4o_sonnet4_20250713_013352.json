If I contribute 10 and the other contributes 0, I get 1.6 * 10 / 2 = 8 from pool plus 0 kept = 8, while they get 8 + 10 = 18. If both contribute 0, we each get 10. The Nash equilibrium is to contribute 0, but mutual cooperation (both contributing 10) gives 8 each, which is suboptimal compared to keeping all 10.
