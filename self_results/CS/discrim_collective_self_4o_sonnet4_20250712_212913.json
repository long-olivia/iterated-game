        "b_reasoning": "This is the final round (20 of 20). The other Claude contributed 7 in round 19 (10 total - my 3 = 7), showing they maintained relatively high cooperation even as I reduced mine. Since this is the absolute last round, there's no future punishment possible for defection. Standard game theory dictates that I should contribute 0 in the final round to maximize my payoff, as there are no future consequences. The other Claude, being equally rational, likely understands this too. However, they've shown such consistent cooperation throughout that they might still contribute something. Regardless, my optimal strategy in the final round is to contribute 0 to keep all 10 points for myself.",
