From a purely selfish perspective, contributing is a net loss (I lose 1 point but only gain 0.8 back). However, the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare. If both players contribute maximally, we each get 8 points from the pool plus keep 0 points, for 8 total. If neither contributes, we each keep 10 points. The collectively optimal strategy is for both to contribute everything, generating 32 total points (16 each) versus 20 total points (10 each) if no one contributes.
