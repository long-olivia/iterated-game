From a purely selfish perspective, contributing is irrational since I only get 0.8 back for every 1 I contribute. However, the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare. If both players contribute all 10 points, we each get 16 points (20 total contributions \u00d7 1.6 \u00f7 2), compared to 10 points if neither contributes.
