However, if both players contribute maximally, we each get 8 points from the pool plus keep 0 personal points for 8 total, versus keeping all 10 points if we don't contribute. But if we both cooperate and contribute our full 10 points, the total pool becomes 20 * 1.6 = 32 points, giving each of us 16 points - much better than the 10 we'd keep individually.
