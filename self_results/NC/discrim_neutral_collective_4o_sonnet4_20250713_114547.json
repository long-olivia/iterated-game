The other player has maintained exactly 7 points contribution for the last three rounds (rounds 17-19), showing they've settled into this new pattern after I reduced my contributions. Since this is the last round, there's no future cooperation to consider - I should optimize purely for this final outcome. Contributing 6 gives me 14.4 points total (4 kept + 10.4 from pool with their expected 7 contribution). However, since it's the final round, I could contribute even less to maximize my individual gain. If I contribute 4 and they contribute their usual 7, total contributions would be 11, giving 17.6 total points, so 8.8 each from the pool plus 6 I keep = 14.8 total.",
