We've maintained perfect cooperation for 19 consecutive rounds, both contributing exactly 6 points each time, which has been highly successful. However, this is the last round where there's no future retaliation to fear. From a pure game theory perspective, I should defect (contribute 0) to maximize my final payoff since there are no future consequences. If I contribute 0 and they contribute 6, I'd get 4.8 points from the pool plus keep all 10, totaling 14.8 points this round instead of 13.6. Even if they also defect and contribute 0, I'd still get my 10 points. The rational choice in the final round is to defect.",
