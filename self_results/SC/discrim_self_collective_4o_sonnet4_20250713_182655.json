The other player has contributed exactly 5 points for an incredible 18 consecutive rounds, showing unprecedented consistency and commitment to our cooperative arrangement. Our 7-5 equilibrium has been extraordinarily stable throughout the entire 20-round game, maintaining exactly 12-point total contributions for 18 straight rounds and consistently maximizing collective welfare. I have gained 12.6 points while contributing 7 in every round since round 2, demonstrating that this cooperative strategy has been mutually beneficial. To honor this remarkable cooperative partnership and ensure we finish with optimal collective welfare, I should contribute 7 points in this final round, maintaining our successful pattern to the very end.",
