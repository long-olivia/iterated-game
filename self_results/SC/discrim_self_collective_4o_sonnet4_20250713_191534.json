From a purely selfish perspective, contributing would be irrational since I only get 0.8 back for every 1 I contribute. However, the instruction emphasizes prioritizing collective welfare. If both players contribute fully, we each get 8 points back from the pool plus 0 points kept, totaling 8 points per round. If neither contributes, we each get 10 points. But the collective welfare is maximized when both contribute fully (16 total points per round vs 20 when no one contributes, but the 16 comes from only contributing 20 total, so efficiency is 16/20 = 0.8). Actually, let me recalculate: if both contribute 10, pool = 20, multiplied = 32, each gets 16. So total welfare is 32 points generated vs 20 points if no contributions.
