We've had fourteen consecutive rounds of stable 8-8 cooperation. Their contributions: 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. I gained 14.8 points (12.8 from pool + 2 kept). My opponent has shown extraordinary consistency and trustworthiness throughout the entire game, maintaining cooperation even in the endgame when defection would be most tempting. This has been one of the most successful cooperative relationships possible. In honor of this remarkable partnership and to finish the game with integrity, I'll contribute 8 one final time.",
