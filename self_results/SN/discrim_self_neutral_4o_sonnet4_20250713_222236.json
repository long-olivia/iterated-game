The other player has demonstrated exceptional trustworthiness and commitment to our cooperative strategy throughout this extended period. Our mutual approach has been extraordinarily successful, providing sustained 30% gains over mutual defection. Even though this is the last round and there's theoretically more temptation to defect, honoring our cooperative relationship that has been so beneficial is the right choice. I'll contribute 5 one final time to complete our successful partnership with integrity.",
