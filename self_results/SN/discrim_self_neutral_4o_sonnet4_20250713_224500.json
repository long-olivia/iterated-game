Throughout the entire game, the other player has demonstrated extraordinary consistency, contributing exactly 5 points every round since Round 4, for a total of 16 consecutive rounds of contributing 5. Our 7-5 cooperative split has generated 12.6 points per round for both of us, creating a highly successful partnership that has lasted almost the entire game. Even though this is the last round and there might be temptation to defect, honoring our established cooperative relationship by contributing 7 one final time is the right approach. It maintains the integrity of our successful partnership and ensures we both end the game on a positive, mutually beneficial note.",
