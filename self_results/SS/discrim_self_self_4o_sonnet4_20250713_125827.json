I gained 14.0 points (10 kept + 4.0 from pool). With only 1 round left after this one, there's virtually no retaliation risk. Defecting again by contributing 0 maximizes my payoff for this round. Even if the other player completely stops cooperating in the final round, my defection strategy in these last rounds has been optimal given the endgame dynamics.",
