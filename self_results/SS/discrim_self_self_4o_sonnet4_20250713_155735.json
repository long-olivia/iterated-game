        "b_reasoning": "In Round 19, I contributed 3 and the total was 9, so the other player contributed 6. Even as I've been reducing my contributions in the endgame, they've maintained high cooperation levels (6, 6, 6 in the last three rounds). I gained 14.2 points (7 kept + 7.2 from pool). This is Round 20 - the final round. In classic game theory, this is when rational players should defect since there's no future retaliation possible. However, the other player has shown extraordinary consistency and cooperative behavior throughout the entire game. Given their pattern, they might still contribute significantly even in the final round. I need to balance the possibility of their continued cooperation against the standard endgame defection strategy. I'll contribute 2 to get some benefit if they cooperate while minimizing my loss if they defect.",
